# Updater
A GUI based on sfPlayer1's matcher that dynamically updates Old School RuneScape deobfuscated gamepack jars.

It allows you to decompile a deob in one revision and refactor it in IntelliJ like normal. When a new version comes out, simply deobfuscate it with the same settings as you previously did, and then pass the new and refactored deob jars into this program.
It will spit out the new jar version with all of your names from previous one.

If you need a deobfuscator for OSRS, you can use mine. Its updated as of revision 213.
